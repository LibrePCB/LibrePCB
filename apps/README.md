# Applications

This directory contains some cmake projects to build applications, like

- LibrePCB itself
- the LibrePCB command line interface
- an importer for Eagle libraries (only for developers)
- a tool to generate random UUIDs (only for developers)

The dependencies between applications and static libraries are shown in the
[architecture overview diagram](../dev/diagrams/svg/architecture_overview.svg):
