/**
 * @brief Base class for network requests which are processed in the network
 * access manager
 *
 * This class lets you execute a network request without blocking the main
 * application thread. After creating an object derived from
 * #NetworkRequestBase, you can connect to signals of that class to track the
 * progress of the request. Then you need to call #start() to start the request
 * processing.
 *
 * @note    You need to ensure that an instance of
 * librepcb::NetworkAccessManager exists while starting a new network request.
 * Otherwise the request will fail. Read the documentation of
 * librepcb::NetworkAccessManager for more information.
