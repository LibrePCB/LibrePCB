/**
 * @brief A network access manager which processes network requests in a
 separate thread
 *
 * @note    One instance of this class must be created in the main application
 thread, and
 *          must be deleted before stopping the main application thread. It's
 not allowed
 *          to create a librepcb::NetworkAccessManager object in other threads,
 or to
 *          create multiple instances at the same time.
 *
 * After the singleton was created, you can get it with the static method
 #instance().
 * But for executing network requests, you don't need to access this object
 directly.
 * You only need the classes librepcb::NetworkRequest and librepcb::FileDownload
 instead.

 * @see librepcb::NetworkRequestBase, librepcb::NetworkRequest,
 librepcb::FileDownload
