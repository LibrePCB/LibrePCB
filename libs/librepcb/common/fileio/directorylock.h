/**
 * @brief This class can be used to implement file-based directory locks
 *
 * Many classes of this project open some directories (workspaces, projects,
 * library elements, ...). But it's very dangerous if a directory is opened
 * multiple times simultaneously (by the same or another instance of the
 * application, maybe even on different computers if the directories are located
 * on a network drive). To avoid such problems, this class provides a mechanism
 * to create directory locks.
 *
 *
 * <b>How such a directory lock works:</b>
 *
 * Let's say that you want to open the directory "/foo/bar/". Then a lock file
 * with the filepath "/foo/bar/.lock" will be created. After closing the
 * directory, the lock file will be removed. So, while the directory (e.g. a
 * project) is open, there will be a lock file in the same directory. If the
 * same or another instance of the application now wants to open the same
 * directory at the same time, the lock file is detected and opening the
 * directory will be denied.
 *
 * The lock file is a simple UTF-8 encoded text file with 5 lines with following
 * values:
 *  -# The full name (first name + last name) of the user which holds the lock
 *  -# The username (logon name) of the user which holds the lock
 *  -# The hostname of the user's computer which holds the lock
 *  -# The process id (PID) of the application instance which holds the lock
 *  -# The process name of the application instance which holds the lock
 *  -# The datetime when the lock file was created/updated (UTC and ISO format!)
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * Homer Simpson
 * homer
 * homer-workstation
 * 1234
 * librepcb
 * 2013-04-13T12:43:52Z
 * @endcode
 *
 * The lock file (and especially its content) is also used to detect application
 * crashes. If the application crashes while a directory was locked, the lock
 * file will still exist after the application was crashed. Now, if the user
 * tries to open the locked directory again, the content of the lock file will
 * be parsed. If the username and the hostname in the lock file is equal to the
 * current user which tries to get the lock, it's clear that the lock file does
 * NOT exist because the locked directory is already open, but that the
 * application was crashed while the directory was locked. If there exists a
 * backup of the locked directory (e.g. project auto-save), this allows to ask
 * the user whether the backup should be restored or not.
 *
 *
 * <b>How to use this class:</b>
 *
 * First, you need to create an instance of this class for the directory you
 * want to protect with a lock. There are two different constructors for this
 * purpose. If you use the default constructor, you need to call #setDirToLock()
 * afterwards. Now you can read the lock status of the specified directory with
 * #getStatus(). With #lock() you can create the lock file, and with #unlock()
 * you can remove the lock file. There are also the two convenience methods
 * #tryLock() and #unlockIfLocked(), just read their documentation for more
 * information.
 *
 * @note    The destructor will automatically call #unlockIfLocked().
 *          This allows a reliable implementation of a directory lock, because
 * you can add a DirectoryLock instance to the attributes of your class which
 * access a directory which should be locked. This will ensure that the lock
 * will be released when your object gets destroyed (RAII). See the code example
 * below.
 *
 * Code Example:
 * @code
 *  class MyDirectoryOpeningClass // a class which opens a directory and needs
 * to lock it
 *  {
 *      public:
 *          MyDirectoryOpeningClass() // constructor
 *              : myLock(FilePath("C:/myDirectory")) // variant 1 to set the
 * filepath
 *          {
 *              myLock.setDirToLock(FilePath("C:/myDirectory")); // variant 2
 *              switch (myLock.getStatus()) // Note: this line can throw an
 * exception!
 *              {
 *                  case Unlocked:
 *                      // No lock exists --> lock the directory now
 *                      myLock.lock(); // Note: this line can throw an
 * exception! break; case Locked:
 *                      // The directory is already locked by another instance!
 *                      throw Exception("Directory is locked!");
 *                      break;
 *                  case StaleLock:
 *                      // The application was crashed while the lock was
 * active.
 *                      // Ask the user whether a backup should be restored or
 * not. break; default:
 *                      // Should not happen...
 *                      break;
 *              }
 *              // if you don't care about stale locks, you could just do this
 * instead:
 *              // myLock.tryLock(); // Note: this line can throw an exception!
 *
 *          }
 *          ~MyDirectoryOpeningClass() // destructor
 *          {
 *              // You do not have to (but you could) call
 * myLock.unlockIfLocked(),
 *              // as it will be called automatically in the destructor of
 * myLock.
 *              // try { myLock.unlockIfLocked(); } catch (...) { }
 *          }
 *
 *      private:
 *          DirectoryLock myLock; // an instance, not only a pointer (important
 * for RAII)!
