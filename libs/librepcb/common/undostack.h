 * librepcb::UndoStack::beginCmdGroup().
 * @li If neccessary, the dtor aborts it with
 * librepcb::UndoStack::abortCmdGroup().
 * @li #append() redirects to librepcb::UndoStack::appendToCmdGroup().

/**
 * @brief The UndoStack class holds UndoCommand objects and provides undo/redo
 * commands
 *
 * Instead of the Qt classes QUndoStack and QUndoCommand we use our own undo
 * classes #UndoStack and #UndoCommand because of the better exception handling
 * and more flexibility.
 *
 * @note Our classes work very similar to the equivalent classes of Qt, so
 * please read the documentation of "Qt's Undo Framework" and classes QUndoStack
 * and QUndoCommand. There is also a more detailed description here: @ref
 * doc_project_undostack
 *
 * Compared with QUndoStack, the biggest differences are the following:
 *  - <b>Support for exceptions:</b> If an exception is throwed in a
 * #UndoCommand object, this undo stack always tries to keep the whole stack
 * consistent (update the index only if the last undo/redo was successful, try
 * to rollback failed changes, ...).
 *  - <b>Removed support for nested macros (QUndoStack#beginMacro() and
 *    QUndoStack#endMacro())</b>: I think we do need this feature (but we have a
 * similar mechanism, see next line)...
 *  - <b>Added support for exclusive macro command creation:</b>
 *
 * @see #UndoCommand, #UndoCommandGroup
