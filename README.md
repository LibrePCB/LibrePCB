## About LibrePCB

LibrePCB is a free [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation)
software to develop printed circuit boards. It runs on Linux, Windows and Mac.
The project is still in a quite early development stage (no stable release available).
See [Project Status](https://docs.librepcb.org/#projectstatus) for more information
about the currently available features, limitations and known bugs.

### Features

- Cross-platform (Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
- Multilingual (both application and library elements)
- All-In-One: project management + library/schematic/board editors
- Intuitive, modern and easy-to-use graphical user interface
- Very powerful library design with some innovative concepts
- Human-readable file formats for both libraries and projects
- Multi-PCB feature (different PCB variants of the same schematic)
- Automatic netlist synchronisation between schematic and board


## Installation & Usage

*Warning: Because LibrePCB's file format is not yet considered as stable (i.e.
breaking changes can occur), you should not yet use LibrePCB productively!*

**Please read our [user manual](https://docs.librepcb.org/) to see how you can
install and use LibrePCB.**
The [Getting Started](https://docs.librepcb.org/getting_started/) guide
gives you a quick introduction to LibrePCB.

In addition to the installation methods described in the user manual, Arch
Linux users can also install the package
[librepcb-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/librepcb-git/) from the AUR.
The package clones and builds the latest (unstable!) version of the `master`
branch from GitHub.

## Development

### Requirements

To compile LibrePCB, you need the following software components:

- g++ >= 4.8, MinGW >= 4.8, or Clang >= 3.3 (C++11 support is required)
- [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) >= 5.2
- [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

#### Prepared Docker Image

Instead of installing the dependencies manually on your system (see instructions
below), you can also use our [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image with all
dependencies pre-installed. Just follow
[these instructions](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/tree/master/dev/docker).

#### Installation on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint

```bash
sudo apt-get install git build-essential qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools libglu1-mesa-dev openssl zlib1g zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install qt5-doc qtcreator # optional
```

#### Installation on Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S git base-devel qt5-base qt5-tools desktop-file-utils shared-mime-info openssl zlib
sudo pacman -S qt5-doc qtcreator # optional
```

#### Installation on Mac OS X

1. Install Xcode through the app store and start it at least once (for the license)
2. Install [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) (**the** package manager)
3. Install *qt5*: `brew update && brew install qt5`
4. Make the toolchain available: `brew unlink qt && brew link --force qt5`

#### Installation on Windows

Download and run the
[Qt for Windows (MinGW) installer](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.8/5.8.0/qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw530-5.8.0.exe)
from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/). LibrePCB does not compile
with MSVC, so you must install following components with the Qt installer:

- The MinGW compiler itself
- The Qt libraries for MinGW

### Cloning

It's important to clone the repository recursively to get all submodules too:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB.git && cd LibrePCB
```

### Building

#### Using Qt Creator

Building with [Qt Creator](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/) is probably the easiest
way. Simply open the `librepcb.pro` file.

When opening a project in Qt Creator for the first time, you need to configure
the Desktop kit:

![qtcreator_run](doc/qtcreator_desktopkit.png)

Click on the "Configure Project" button to get started.

Note: To keep build time as low as possible make sure to set the correct make
flags to use all available CPU cores to build. See this [stackoverflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860712/setting-default-make-options-for-qt-creator).

#### Using qmake and make

Since Qt Creator is also using qmake and make to build, it's easy to do the same
on the command line:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
qmake -r ../librepcb.pro
make -j 8
```

### Run LibrePCB

#### From Qt Creator

Select the run configuration `librepcb` and click on the `Run` button:

![qtcreator_run](doc/qtcreator_run.png)

#### From Command Line

```bash
./generated/unix/librepcb                  # Unix/Linux
open ./build/generated/mac/librepcb.app    # Mac OS X
generated\windows\librepcb.exe             # Windows
```

### Installation

On a Unix/Linux system, LibrePCB can be installed with `sudo make install`.

### Workspace

At the first startup, LibrePCB asks for a workspace directory where the library
elements and projects are located. For developers there is a demo workspace
inclusive some libraries and projects in the submodule
[`dev/demo-workspace/`](https://github.com/LibrePCB/demo-workspace).
