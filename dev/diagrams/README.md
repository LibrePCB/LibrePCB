# Development Diagrams

Older diagrams are created with [Dia](http://live.gnome.org/Dia), newer
diagrams with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

**Legacy for Dia:**
- Please save all projects uncompressed (file -> save as -> uncheck
  "compress file")!
- The bash script [convert.sh](./convert.sh) converts all diagrams to SVG and
  saves them in the directory [svg](./svg).
