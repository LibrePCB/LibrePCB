== Setting up and using GIT With LibrePCB
:imagesdir: using_git

All of the official LibrePCB libraries are hosted in repositories  on github.com under the username LibrePCB-Libraries
and are available for download. They are also mirrored on the LibrePCB.org library server. Anyone wanting to donate to
these libraries must have a github.com account and follow the procedures outlined in this document.

Librarians should always create a separate LibrePCB workspace and only use it for editing libraries. Edits can only  be done
on local libraries and you cannot have a remote copy of any library that you are working on in the workspace.
